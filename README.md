  A basic React app integrated with Firebase, using a simple binary search.

  ### About
  I created this minigame as a small practice while learning how to use firebase. 
  
  All you need to do is think of a number and then give the machine feedback for its guesses -   
  Is it correct? or perhaps too low or too high?  
 
  Your machine will recieve a score based on how many guesses it took to guess right.  
  Name your machine so it can have a unique name among the high-scores.
  
  High scores are updated live and stored using Firebase.
